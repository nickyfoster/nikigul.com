Welcome to my personal tech blog! My name is Nikita and I am a devops engineer with a focus on automation, CI/CD, and Kubernetes.

As a devops engineer, I spend my days working on the infrastructure and tools that support the development and deployment of software applications. This includes everything from setting up and maintaining cloud environments, to automating the build and deployment processes and managing containerized applications in k8s.

One of the things I love most about my job is the opportunity to work with a wide range of technologies and constantly learn and grow as a professional. In this blog, I plan to share some of the things I have learned and experienced in my work as a devops engineer, as well as any other tech-related topics that I find interesting.

I hope you enjoy reading my posts and that you find them useful and informative. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out!
