## Introduction
SRE Labs is a comprehensive project that combines the power of Terraform and Ansible to streamline the creation and configuration of EC2 servers in AWS. Created for SRE practices, it provides a hands-on environment for various operational scenarios like Linux server troubleshooting, infrastructure testing, and more.

## Project Overview
The core of SRE Labs lies in its ability to dynamically create and configure AWS EC2 instances. Utilizing Terraform, it automates the provisioning of virtual servers in the cloud. Ansible comes into play for the configuration phase, where each server is set up according to the specific needs of the lab.

## Key Features
- **Automated Server Provisioning**: Terraform scripts for rapid and consistent deployment of AWS EC2 instances.
- **Dynamic Configuration**: Ansible playbooks created to specific lab scenarios, like Linux server troubleshooting.
- **Customizable Labs**: Easy-to-modify templates to create diverse environments catering to various SRE training and testing needs.
- **Cost-Efficient**: Resources are managed efficiently, minimizing costs while providing a robust platform for learning and experimentation.

## Use Cases
- **Educational Purposes**: Ideal for training aspiring SREs, providing them with real-world scenarios to hone their skills.
- **Troubleshooting Practice**: Specific labs designed to mimic common server issues, offering hands-on troubleshooting experience.
- **Infrastructure Testing**: Testing infrastructure-as-code and configuration management practices in a controlled, repeatable environment.

## Getting Started
The SRE Labs project is accessible and designed for ease of use. To get started, you will need an AWS account and basic familiarity with Terraform and Ansible. Detailed instructions and all necessary scripts are available in the repository.
